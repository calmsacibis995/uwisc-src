Added code to dial in and out on same modem. (Compatible with uucp).

Updated locking code to use the same as uucp.

Added a working Hayes dialer.

A change has been included to allow comma
separated entries in the "va" field of the remote file.  This is the field
that specifies the dialer type.  With more dialers available it is more likely
that they will be of different types.  If the number of "va" subfields is less
than the number of "dv" (i.e. device name) fields the device type that of
the last previously specified device.
Example from our own /etc/remote:
	:dv=/dev/ttyd2,/dev/ttyd1,/dev/ttyd0:at=hayes,vadic:
The first modem /dev/ttyd2 is a hayes.  The second two modems /dev/ttyd1 and
/dev/ttyd0 are vadics.

It is assumed in tip that the dialin/dialout devices have names /dev/ttyd?.
Other names will require modifications.

Added variable "toscreen" which echos the data being ~< or ~> to the
screen to make old "cu" users happier. Default is off (don't echo to the
screen)

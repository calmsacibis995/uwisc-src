All alignments on a double word boundary (via .align 3) converted
to .align 2, as that is all that the assembler guarantees.
(NB: Floating point values can be aligned on any boundary...)

A bug in exp.s attempted to relocate an immediate floating
point constant; this makes no sense.
	movd	$huge, r0
changed to
	movd	huge, r0
which is what they wanted anyway

Basically, to run UUCP on top of TCP, the code had to be changed to
not do ioctl's on sockets,etc. Also, a new protocl 't' was added.
This is because the 'g' protocol maxes out at about 9000 baud
regardless of the physical medium. The 't' protocol presumes an
error free channel, and is essentially the 'g' protocol with the
checksumming and packetizing ripped out.

To install it, make uucp with BSD4_2 defined in uucp.h.

Add a line in /etc/services that looks like:
uucp		540/tcp		uucpd

Add lines to /etc/rc.local that looks something like:
if [ -f /etc/uucpd ]; then
	/etc/uucpd & echo -n ' uucpd'				>/dev/console
fi

The L.sys entry should look something like:
uucpname time-to-call TCP port networkname standard uucp login chat

This is how it would look for rochester.
rochester Any TCP uucp ur-seneca "" uucplogin "" uucppasswd

UUCP site rochester is arpanet site ur-seneca (and there is a 
arpanet site rochester  that is a different machine)

The "port" field is either a word or a number. It is a number,
that number is used as the port. If it is a word, the word is
looked up in /etc/services and the port is taken from there.

Another example would be:
seismo Any TCP 33 seismo "" uucplogin "" uucppassword

In almost every case, the networkname field will be the same as the
uucpname field. Similarly, the port field will usually be "uucp", which
says to use the standard uucp port from the services file.

The daemon expects the incoming site to send its login and password
for authentication.

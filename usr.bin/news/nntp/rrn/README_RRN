Updated hacks to change rn into rrn	28 June 1986

Everything is now automated to install the changes and have
the source co-resident with the non-network version.  These
changes also work with rn patches up to #27, and with the
Georgia Tech patch to make "rn" compatible with 2.10.3 news.

To install, simply run the shell file MAKE_RRN_CHANGES in
the "rn" source directory  (you may need to alter the file to
include the location of the "patch" command).  After the file is
run, "ifdef" changes for the "rrn" version will have been included
in strategic locations, and a few extra shell files should be
in place.  Running "Configure" and answering the questions should
provide you with either the local version (rn) or the network version
(rrn).

Good luck.

Hacks to change rn into rrn		31 August 1985

     The following steps should be followed to set up "rrn" on
your system.  The files in this directory are somewhat modified
versions of those distributed with normal rn 4.3.  However, some
things were overly-difficult to change, and you will have to
hack them in by hand later.  Fortunately, that's mostly
trivial.

     1. Run "Configure", as usual.  However, make one change --
	make your news spool directory be "/tmp", instead of
	whatever it would normally be.

     2. Edit the file "config.h".  Append two lines to the end of
	the file:

	#define SERVER
	#define SERVER_HOST	"xxx"

	The first line tells the compiler that you want the
	remote news reading hacks compiled in.  The second
	tells it that the host to query for news and to send
	posted articles to is "xxx".  Obviously, "xxx" should be
	changed to whatever machine name is apropriate.
	
     3. Type "make"...

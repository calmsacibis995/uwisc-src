.SH DESCRIPTION
.I uucico
performs the actual work involved in transferring files between
systems. 
.I uucp
and
.I uux
merely queue requests for data transfer which uucico processes.
.PP
The following options are available.
.TP 8
.BI \-d spooldir
Use
.I spooldir
as the spool directory.
.TP 8
.BI \-g grade
Only send jobs of grade
.I grade
or higher this transfer.
.TP 8
.B \-R
Reverse roles. This tells the remote system to begin sending its
jobs first, instead of waiting for the local machine to finish.
.TP 8
.BI \-r role
.I role
is either 1 or 0. It signifies whether uucico is to run in 
master or slave mode. 1 is used when starting 
.I uucico
by hand. 0 is used when another system calls the local system.
.TP 8
.BI \-s system
Call only system
.IR system .
If 
.B \-s
is not specified, and \-r1 is specifed,
.I uucico
will attempt to call all systems for which there is work.
If
.B \-s
is specified, a call will be made even if there is
no work for that system. This is useful for polling
systems.
.TP 8
.BI \-x debug
Turn on debugging at level
.IR debug .
Level 5 is a good start when trying to find out why a call
failed. Level 9 is very detailed. Level 99 is absurdly verbose.
.TP 8
.B \-L
Only call ``local'' sites. A site is considered local if
the device-type field in 
.I L.sys
is one of LOCAL, DIR or TCP.
.TP 8
.BI \-t turnaround
Use
.I turnaround
as the line turnaround time (in minutes) instead of the default 30.  If 
.I turnaround
is missing or 0, line turnaround will be disabled.
After uucico has been running in Slave mode for
.I turnaround 
minutes, it will attempt to run in master mode by negotiating with the
remote machine.  In the past, a large transfer of news in
one direction would hold up mail going in the other direction.
With the turnaround code working, the message flow will be more
bidirectional in the short term.
This option only works with newer uucicos and is ignored by older ones.
.PP
If
.I uucico
receives a
.B SIGFPE
(see
.IR kill (1))
it will toggle the debugging on or off.
.PP
This program will typically be started by
.IR cron (8).
.PP
.B uupoll
is used to force a poll of a remote system. It queues a null job
for the remote system and invokes 
.I uucico.
If the
.I \-g
flag is specified, the null job will be queued with grade 
.IR grade .
If
.I \-n
is specified, the null job will be queued, but an immediate
.I uucico
will not be invoked.
.SH FILES
.TP 22
/usr/lib/uucp
directory with commands used by uucico internally
.TP
/usr/spoool/uucp
spool directory

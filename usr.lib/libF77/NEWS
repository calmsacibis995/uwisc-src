		LibF77 News - most recent first

August 9, 1985:
   add d_dprod() for dprod() when -r8 flag is used.

July 6, 1985:
   switch r_lg10 and d_lg10 to use new log10 in -lm.
   switch functions of form r_*.c to be declared as float instead of double.
   use -f flag for most single precision routines to get around C bug;
	also put extra stores in 4 routines to bypass bug (See Usef in
	Makefile & file Test_float).

June 26, 1985:
   move f77_abort() from libF77/main.c to libI77/f77_abort.c
	so C progs can call f77 subroutines. 
   fix pow_ii to divide by zero for i**j where i=0 and j is < 0
   fix pow_hh by applying all fixes from pow_ii to it.

June 6, 1985, 4.3BSD beta version:
   all error exits now go through f77_abort().  Normally get dump
	only if loaded with -lg (via f77 -g).  Can use f77_dump_flag
	envir. var. to override that (set it to 'y' or 'n').

   new routine: random()

   delete sinh.o, tanh.o - identical to C routines in libm
	  cabs.o, d_sqrt.o, z_abs.o - now in assembler in libm
	  bit.o: not documented, man 3f bit now shows better ways.
		routines in bit.o also had inverse arg. order to built in funct.

   complex division by zero - now get error comment.

Meanwhile, I thought of something else you may want to include in the
distribution.  I know that there are lots of bugs in uucp, and that it
would be impossible to list them all in a reasonable amount of space,
but news will not work at all on a 4.1bsd system unless this bug is
fixed.  This bug is still in even the latest tape from Berkeley, and is
not traceable with a debugger because of other bugs in uucp.  This bug
causes uucico to core-dump after transferring some small (~20) number
of files.

The fix is easy.  In anlwrk.c, routine iswrk():

  	  || !prefix(pre, *listp)) {
  		int i;
  		for (i = 0, listp = list; i < LLEN; i++) {

[uucp is fully of nasty bugs.  watch net.bugs.uucp for them and
hopefully their fixes.]

This directory contains:
	binaries for ``ddlrun'' and ``ddlcomp''
	Documentation for writing your own DDL program is in
		the "doc" directory.
	An example DDL game is in the "sample" directory.
	To compile a DDL program do:
		ddlcomp destination-file < source.ddl
	You then run the game with:
		   ddlrun destination-file
	DDL produces large-appearing files that are full of holes
	and should not be copied.
	Note: DDL source for "aardvark" is contained in ../aard.

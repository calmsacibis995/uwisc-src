Bug?
	update after scroll in non-full width window

Misc:
	Look at why WWU_MAJOR is set so often
	Cursor movements shouldn't use wwwrite().
	ww_ob should be baudrate dependent.
	tt_ob should be malloc()ed in ttinit().

Better error reporting.
	Wwerrstr.

Multiple selected windows

Stopped children.

ttgeneric:
	deal with xn and other ugly flags
	use the m? strings in termcap.

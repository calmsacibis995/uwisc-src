The code in this directory is the most up-to-date network source
on the machine.

NOTE: if you are already running my stuff, this version has a new protocol
that is incompatible on a link-by-link basis with the earlier one.
Take a look at prot.c and the packet structure of defs.h.

*** Adding a new machine

To add another machine to an existing network, change these programs:

* mach.h:
	add an ifdef entry for the new machines
* config.h:
	add in LOCALx section of config.h
	   the usual information about the machine interconnections
	add the name of the machine to the machine
	   name table and its type to the machine type table
* Paths.h:
	Change the path names in "Paths.h".
* makefile:
	change the makefile to suit.
* nsh.c:
	Change the path names in "nsh.c".
* sub.c:
	check routine "gothru"
* v6mail.c:
	add machine names to "v6mail.c"

To set up a new network, I suggest starting with two machines and
get everything up as you like it, then including others.
Follow the steps outlined above.  A good way to see the specific
places where another network has been changed is to 
	grep RAND *.h *.c


*** Other files ***
interact.c, listen.c -	manually send packets
speeds.c, speedr.c -	send various length packets, use "time" to evaluate
store.c, receive.c -	send a file (use for backup)
nettest.c -		run daemons locally, using pipes instead of tty lines
setmode.c -		set the mode on the tty line driver to "cat" things thru

***	Taxonomy of net pgms being sent around:

Internal:	sendberkmail, prmail, mmail, mwrite
External:	net, netcp, netlpr, netmail
Other:		netdaemon, netstart, netq, netrm

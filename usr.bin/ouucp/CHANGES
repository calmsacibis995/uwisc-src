Running uucico with debugging on requires read access to L.sys.

If "NOSTRANGERS" is defined in uucp.h, the remote site
must be in you L.sys or the call will be rejected.

Lock files may be kept in a subdirectory if desired.

STST files are kept in a subdirectory.

CORRUPT subdirectory contains corrupted C. and X. files that could
not be processed. (Instead of just exiting)

You can specify a maximum grade to send either on the command line (-gX)
or in the L.sys file (Any/C|Evening will only send class C [usually
mail] or higher during the day and will send everything in the evening)
See UUAIDS/L.sys for examples.

L.sys (and any of the files in lib/uucp) can contain comments by
putting a # as the first character on a line. Lines may be
continued by placing a \ as the last character of the line.

-R flag reverses role. (Lets the remote system be master first instead
of slave)

-L flag only calls "local" sites. Local sites are those sites having
one of LOCAL,TCP or DIRECT in the ACU field of L.sys.

If /etc/nologin is present (usually created by a graceful shutdown),
uucico and uuxqt will gracefully exit instead of getting killed
off when the system goes down.

Does an exponential backoff on retry time if call fails instead
of always waiting the default 5 minutes. The default may be
overridden by adding ",TIME" to the time field in L.sys. e.g.
"seismo Any,2" will use a default retry time of 2 minutes.

If uucico receives a SIGFPE while running, it will toggle debugging
on and off.

Better status messages provided for uustat.

New program uuq to give more decriptive information on status of
jobs in uucp queue.

Don't send files to remote system if it is returning out of
temp space error.

Correctly does the closing hangup sequence.

condevs.c was broken into a file for each dialer in the
directory aculib for much easier maintenance.

Only try at most TRYCALLS to dial a site instead of one try
for each dialer (lost big on systems with many dialers)

Add ABORT sequence to the expect/send sequence so don't have
to wait for timeout if can't get through dataswitch. e.g.
	noao Evening ACU 1200 6021234565 "" \d\r CLASS NOAOUUCP ABORT Down GO \d\r ogin:-\b-ogin: uucplogin word: uucppassword
will only call noao in the evening (evening is defined by the phone rates).
It will expect nothing and then wait 1 second (\d) and send a carriage return.
Look for CLASS, then send NOAOUUCP. From then on, if it sees the word Down
before finishing logging in, it will hang up immediately. In the mean time,
it looks for GO and if it sees it, delays 1 second and sends a CR. Looks
for ogin:, etc. This abort sequence is very useful if you must go through a 
dataswitch to get to the computer.

The time field in L.sys now handles "Evening" and "Night" in addition
to Any, Mo,Tu,We,Th,Fr,Sa,Su. Evening and Night are defined to
be when the phone rates are cheaper.
	Evening = Wk1700-0800|Sa|Su
	Night = Any2300-0800|Sa|Su0800-1700

The expect/send code now supports:
	\s	space
	\d	delay 1 second
	\r	carriage return with no linefeed
	\b	break
	\c	don't send a CR after these characters
	\xxx	the octal character xxx (e.g. \s == \040

L-devices now handles "chat" scripts (like HoneyDanber) to get
through local port selectors and smart modems more easily
without mucking up every line of L.sys. See UUAIDs/L-devices for
details.

The 'g'  protocol code was cleaned up a lot and is now almost
readable.

If you need a parity other than even (the default) to login to
another system, you can change it in L.sys by putting in a
sequence like "" P_ZERO (expect nothing, send zero parity).
	Odd Parity	P_ODD
	Even Parity	P_EVEN
	Zero Parity	P_ZERO
	One Parity	P_ONE

If DONTCOPY is defined in uucp.h, uucp will not make a copy
of the source file by default. (This is the way System 3 does it).

If an X. request fails, the notification is returned to the
originator of the request instead of "uucp" on the previous
system. 

The man pages are actually accurate!

If LOGBYSITE is defined, uucp logging is done with
a log file per site instead of one LOGFILE. (Like Honey DanBer does)

There is a new file (optional) L.aliases that makes life simpler when
a site changes it's name. uucp, uux, uucico, etc all check it so 
when a site is renamed (e.g convex <- parsec) all you have to do is add
an entry in L.aliases of the form:
newname oldname

uucico will not try and resend files it has already sent (when the
files are specified in one C. file)

Incorporated Bill Sebok's code to dial in and out on the same modem.
NOTE: acucntrl is heavily Vax/4.xbsd specific and will require work to
run on any other system.

For compatibility with Honey DanBer, in the Date fields of L.sys,
	| was changed to , (| is supported, but not encouraged)
	, was changed to ; (to allow , to be the date seperator)

For Honey DanBer compatibility, the Grade flag is now passed as
	-vgrade=X instead of the old -pX

Don't truncate site names to 7 characters (truncate to 14 if
anyone gets that absurd) for HDB compatibility.  L.aliases may
be used to map host with longer names in L.sys to 7 character
names that some hosts send.  Entries should be 

	fullname 7-char-name

You can specify a time for the expect send sequences with ~ instead
of getting the default MAXMSGTIME. E.g.
	system Any ACU 1200 1234567 ogin~20-\r-ogin~10-\b-ogin user password pw
will look for ogin for 20 seconds, send CR, look for ogin for 10
seconds, send a BREAK and look for ogin for MAXMSGTIME seconds

Added code to support GTEs PC Pursuit service. It's mainly the handling of the
dialback they use.

Added time "NonPeak" for Tymnet/Telenet services that charge lower
rates from 6pm-7am M-F and Sat & Sun.

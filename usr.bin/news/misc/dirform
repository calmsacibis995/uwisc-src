============================================================================

The entire map is intended to be processed by pathalias, a program that
generates UUCP routes from this data.  All lines beginning in `#' are
comment lines to pathalias, however the UUCP Project has defined a set
of these comment lines to have specific format so that a complete
database could be built.

The generic form of these lines is

#<field id letter><tab><field data>

Each host has an entry in the following format.  The entry should begin
with the #N line, end with a blank line after the pathalias data, and
not contain any other blank lines, since there are ed, sed, and awk
scripts that use expressions like /^#N $1/,/^$/ for the purpose of
separating the map out into files, each containing one site entry.

#N	UUCP name of site
#S	manufacturer machine model; operating system & version
#O	organization name
#C	contact person's name
#E	contact person's electronic mail address
#T	contact person's telephone number
#P	organization's address
#L	longitude / latitude
#R	remarks
#U	netnews neighbors
#W	who last edited the entry ; date edited

Specific Field Descriptions

#N	system name

Your system's UUCP name should go here. Either the uname(1) command
from System III or System V UNIX; or the uuname(1) command from Version
7 UNIX will tell you what UUCP is using for the local UUCP name.

One of the goals of the UUCP Project is to keep duplicate UUCP host
names from appearing because there exist mailers in the world which
assume that the UUCP name space contains no duplicates (and attempts
UUCP path optimization on that basis), and it's just plain confusing to
have two different sites with the same name.

At present, the most severe restriction on UUCP names is that the name
must be unique somewhere in the first six characters, because of a poor
software design decision made by AT&T for the System V release of UNIX.

This does not mean that your site name has to be six characters or less
in length. Just unique within that length.

With regard to choosing system names, HARRIS'S LAMENT:

	``All the good ones are taken.''

#S	machine type; operating system

This is a quick description of your equipment. Machine type should
be manufacturer and model, and after a semi-colon(;), the operating
system name and version number (if you have it). Some examples:

	DEC PDP-11/70; 2.9 BSD UNIX
	DEC PDP-11/45; ULTRIX-11
	DEC VAX-11/780; VMS 4.0
	SUN 2/150; 4.2 BSD UNIX
	Pyramid 90x; OSx 2.1
	CoData 3300; Version 7 UniPlus+
	Callan Unistar 200; System V UniPlus+
	IBM PC/XT; Coherent
	Intel 386; XENIX 3.0
	CRDS Universe 68; UNOS

#O	organization name

This should be the full name of your organization, squeezed to fit
inside 80 columns as necessary. Don't be afraid to abbreviate where the
abbreviation would be clear to the entire world (say a famous
institution like MIT or CERN), but beware of duplication (In USC the C
could be either California or Carolina).

#C	contact person

This should be the full name (or names, separated by commas) of the
person responsible for handling queries from the outside world about
your machine.

#E	contact person's electronic address

This should be just a machine name, and a user name, like
`ucbvax!fair'. It should not be a full path, since we will be able to
generate a path to the given address from the data you're giving us.
There is no problem with the machine name not being the same as the #N
field (i.e. the contact `lives' on another machine at your site).

Also, it's a good idea to give a generic address or alias (if your mail
system is capable of providing aliases) like `usenet' or `postmaster',
so that if the contact person leaves the institution or is re-assigned
to other duties, he doesn't keep getting mail about the system. In a
perfect world, people would send notice to the UUCP Project, but in
practice, they don't, so the data does get out of date. If you give a
generic address you can easily change it to point at the appropriate
person.

Multiple electronic addresses should be separated by commas, and all of
them should be specified in the manner described above.

#T	contact person's telephone number

Format: +<country code><space><area code><space><prefix><space><number>

Example:

#T	+1 415 642 1024

This is the international format for the representation of phone
numbers. The country code for the United States of America is 1. Other
country codes should be listed in your telephone book.

If you must list an extension (i.e. what to ask the receptionist for,
if not the name of the contact person), list it after the main phone
number with an `x' in front of it to distinguish it from the rest of
the phone number.

Example:

#T	+1 415 549 3854 x37

Multiple phone numbers should be separated by commas, and all of them
should be completely specified as described above to prevent confusion.

#P      organization's address

This field should be one line filled with whatever else anyone would
need after the contact person's name, and your organization's name
(given in other fields above), to mail you something in the physical
mails. Generally, if there's room, it's best to spell out things
like Road, Street, Avenue, and Boulevard, since this is an international
network, and the abbreviations will not necessarily be obvious to someone
from Finland, for example.

#L      longitude and latitude

This should be in the following format:

#L	NN MM [SS] N|S / NNN MM [SS] E|W  [city]

Two fields, with optional third.

First number is Latitude in degrees (NN), minutes (MM), and seconds (SS),
and a N or S to indicate North or South of the Equator.

A Slash Separator.

Second number is Longitude in degrees (NNN), minutes (MM), and seconds (SS),
and a E or W to indicate East or West of the Prime Meridian in Greenwich,
England.

Seconds are optional, but it is worth noting that the more accurate you
are, the more accurate maps we can make of the network (including
blow-ups of various high density areas, like New Jersey, or the San
Francisco Bay Area).

If you give the coordinates for your city (i.e. without fudging for
where you are relative to that), add the word `city' at the end of the
end of the specification, to indicate that. If you know where you are
relative to a given coordinate for which you have longitude and
latitude data, then the following fudge factors can be useful:

1 degree	=	69.2 miles	=	111 kilometers
1 minute	=	1.15 miles	=	1.9 kilometers
1 second	=	101.5 feet	=	31 meters

The Prime Meridian is through Greenwich, England, and longitudes go no
higher than 180 degrees West or East of Greenwich. Latitudes go no
higher than 90 degrees North or South of the Equator.

Beware that the distance between two degrees of longitude decreases as
you get further away from the Equator. (Imagine all those longitudinal
lines converging on the north and south poles...) These numbers are
good for the Equator.  If you're in Alaska or Norway, for example, they
are certainly too large for you to fudge longitude accurately.

#R      remarks

This is for one line of comment. As noted before, all lines beginning
with a `#' character are comment lines, so if you need more than one
line to tell us something about your site, do so between the end of the
map data (the #?\t fields) and the pathalias data.

#U	netnews neighbors

The USENET is the network that moves netnews around, specifically,
net.announce. If you send net.announce to any of your UUCP neighbors,
list their names here, delimited by spaces. Example:

#U	ihnp4 decvax mcvax seismo

Since some places have lots of USENET neighbors, continuation lines
should be just another #U and more site names.

#W      who last edited the entry and when

This field should contain an email address, a name in parentheses,
followed by a semi-colon, and the output of the date program.
Example:

#W	ucbvax!fair (Erik E. Fair); Sat Jun 22 03:35:16 PDT 1985

The same rules for email address that apply in the contact's email
address apply here also. (i.e. only one system name, and user name).
It is intended that this field be used for automatic ageing of the
map entries so that we can do more automated checking and updating
of the entire map. See getdate(3) from the netnews source for other
acceptable date formats.

PATHALIAS DATA (or, documenting your UUCP connections & frequency of use)

The DEMAND, DAILY, etc., entries represent imaginary connect costs (see
below) used by pathalias to calculate lowest cost paths.  The cost
breakdown is:

	LOCAL		25	local area network
	DEDICATED	95	high speed dedicated
	DIRECT		200	local call
	DEMAND          300     normal call (long distance, anytime)
	HOURLY		500	hourly poll
	EVENING		1800	time restricted call
	DAILY		5000	daily poll
	WEEKLY		30000	irregular poll
	DEAD            a very high number - not usable path

Additionally, HIGH and LOW (used like DAILY+HIGH) are -5 and +5
respectively, for baud-rate or quality bonuses/penalties.  Arithmetic
expressions can be used, however, you should be aware that the results
are often counter-intuitive (e.g. (DAILY*4) means every 4 days, not 4
times a day).

The numbers are intended to represent frequency of connection, which
seems to be far more important than baud rates for this type of
traffic.  There is an assumed high overhead for each hop; thus,
HOURLY is far more than DAILY/24.

There are a few other cost names that sometimes appear in the map;
these are discouraged.  Some are synonyms for the prefered
names above (e.g. POLLED means DAILY), some are obsolete (e.g.
the letters A through F, which are letter grades for connections.)
It is not acceptable to make up new names or spellings (pathalias
gets very upset when people do that...).

LOCAL AREA NETWORKS

For local area networks, (since they are usually completely connected),
there is a list notation for specifying them. Usually there is one
gateway machine to the outside world; it is best that the definition of
the network appear in that system's pathalias entry, and the other
systems just note that they connect to the LAN.  An abbreviated map
entry for the sake of example:

#N	frobozz
#O	Frobozz Skonk Works
#C	Joe Palooka
#E	frobozz!postmaster
#R	gateway machine to Frobozz Company LAN
#
frobozz	ucbvax(DEMAND), ihnp4(EVENING), seismo(DAILY),
	mcvax(WEEKLY), akgua(EVENING)
#
#	LAN addressed user@host
#
FROBOZZ-ETHER = @{frobozz, frob1, frob2, frob3}(LOCAL)
#
#	LAN addressed BerkNet style host:user
#
FROBOZZ-BERKNET = {frobozz, frob4, frob5, frob6}:(LOCAL)

For the other sites on the LAN, their map entries should reflect
who is in charge of the machine, and their pathalias data
would appear like this (again, this example is abbreviated):

#N	frob1
#O	Frobozz Skonk Works, Software Development System
#C	Joe Palooka
#E	frobozz!postmaster
#
frob1	FROBOZZ-ETHER

WHAT TO DO WITH THIS STUFF

Once you have finished constructing your pathalias entry, mail it off
to {ucbvax,ihnp4,akgua,seismo}!cbosgd!uucpmap, which is a mailing list
of the regional map coordinators.  They maintain assigned geographic
sections of the map, and the entire map is posted on a rolling basis in
the USENET newsgroups mod.map.uucp over the course of a month (at the
end of the month they start over).

Questions or comments about this specification should also be directed at
cbosgd!uucpmap.

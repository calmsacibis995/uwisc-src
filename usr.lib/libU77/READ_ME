		UNIX f77 System Interface Library
			February, 1981


This library includes all generally useful system functions that are not
required by the ANSI standard.  Some of the original libF77 routines are
here (getarg, getenv, iargc). Some Unix functions are not provided because
they would be very awkward to use from f77 (eg. pipe, popen *).

The user interface to these functions is different in some cases from the
C equivalent. This is primarily to make them easier to use from FORTRAN.
This library is still expanding, but additions should be judicious.

Install the sources here in parallel with the libI77 sources. Then:

	make libI77.a
	make install
	cd man
	make install



* These will be added to libI77/f_open in the near future.

Please send bug reports, fixes, etc. to one of

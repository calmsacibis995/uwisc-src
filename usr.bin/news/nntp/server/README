     Caveat: Before compiling anything here, go look at README and conf.h
in the "common" directory.  Fix conf.h up, and then come back here.

     Back already?  Ok.  Now following the bouncing numbers:

	1. Create the access file with the proper entries.
	   This file goes wherever you said ACCESS_FILE
	   was supposed to be in common/conf.h.  It's format is
	   explained in the manual entry for nntpd.8c.
	   A sample access file is in ../support/access_file.
	   If you don't care who (ab)uses your news server,
	   you can have the line "default read post" in your access
	   file, which will allow anyone on the network to
	   read and post news via your server.  See the manual
	   page for a better explanation.

	2. Make an entry for "nntp" in /etc/services.  Should
	   be port number 119, tcp.  I.e., should look something like:

nntp		119/tcp		readnews untp	# Network News Transfer Protocol

	3. Check ../common/conf.h to make sure you're set to do what
	   you want to do with inetd (i.e., #define ALONE or #undef ALONE).
	   If you are using inetd,

	   a. Add a line to /etc/inetd.conf, or whatever your
	      configuration file is, to reflect the presence
	      of the news server.  This should look like:

nntp	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/etc/nntpd	nntpd

	      Don't forget to kill -HUP your inetd later...

	   If you're NOT using inetd,

	   a. Edit ../common/conf.h to have the line

			#define ALONE

	      to compile in code for the stand alone server.

	   b. You may as well also define "FASTFORK" in
	      ../common/conf.h.  This causes the server not to
	      read in the active file every time it forks, but
	      rather to stat it every READINTVL seconds, and if
	      the file has changed since the last read, to
	      read it in again.  This makes the children run
	      faster, since they don't have to read the active
	      file every time the parent forks off a child, but
	      the parent server will eat more cpu, doing
	      stat()s every 10 minutes or so.  If your server machine
	      is heavily loaded, you might leave this out.

	   c. Change /etc/rc.local to start the server at
	      boot time.

	4. Compile the server by doing "make".

	5. Cd .. and continue with the rest of the stuff; you'll
	   wind up doing a make install later.

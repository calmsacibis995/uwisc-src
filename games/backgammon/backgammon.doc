NAME
     backgammon - the game of backgammon

SYNOPSIS
     _b_a_c_k_g_a_m_m_o_n [ - ] [ n r w b pr pw pb t_t_e_r_m s_f_i_l_e ]

DESCRIPTION
     This program lets you play backgammon against  the  computer
     or against a "friend".  All commands only are one letter, so
     you don't need to type a carriage return, except at the  end
     of  a move.  The program is mostly self documenting, so that
     a question mark (?) will usually  get  some  help.   If  you
     answer  `y' when the program asks if you want the rules, you
     will get text explaining the rules of the game,  some  hints
     on  strategy,  instruction  on how to use the program, and a
     tutorial consisting of a practice game against the computer.
     A  description  of how to use the program can be obtained by
     answering `y' when it asks if you want instructions.

     The possible arguments for backgammon (most  are  unnecesary
     but some are very convenient) consist of:

        _n       don't ask for rules or instructions
        _r       player is red (implies n)
        _w       player is white (implies n)
        _b       two players, red and white (implies n)
        _p_r      print the board before red's turn
        _p_w      print the board before white's turn
        _p_b      print the board before both player's turn
        _t_t_e_r_m   terminal is type _t_e_r_m, uses /etc/termcap
        _s_f_i_l_e   recover previously saved game from _f_i_l_e.  (This
                can also be done by executing the saved file,
                i.e., typing its name in as a command)

     Arguments may be optionally preceded by a `-'.  Several  ar-
     guments  may  be concatenated together, but not after `s' or
     `t' arguments, since they can be followed  by  an  arbitrary
     string.   Any  unrecognized arguments are ignored.  An argu-
     ment of a lone `-' gets a description of possible arguments.

     If _t_e_r_m has capabilities for  direct  cursor  movement  (see
     ttycap(VII)),  _b_a_c_k_g_a_m_m_o_n "fixes" the board after each move,
     so the board does not  need  to  be  reprinted,  unless  the
     screen suffers some horrendous malady.  Also, any `p' option
     will be ignored.  (The `t' option is  not  necessary  unless
     the  terminal type does not match the entry in the /etc/htmp
     data base.)

QUICK REFERENCE
     When the program prompts by typing only your color,  type  a
     space or carriage return to roll, or

        _d       to double
        _p       to print the board
        _q       to quit

        _s       to save the game for later

     When the program prompts with 'Move:', type

        _p       to print the board
        _q       to quit
        _s       to save the game

     or a _m_o_v_e, which is a sequence of

        _s-_f     move from _s to _f
        _s/_r     move one man on _s the roll _r

     separated by commas or spaces and  ending  with  a  newline.
     Available abbreviations are

        _s-_f_1-_f_2   means _s-_f_1,_f_1-_f_2
        _s/_r_1_r_2    means _s/_r_1,_s/_r_2

     Use `b' for bar and `h' for home, or 0 or 25 as appropriate.

BUGS
     The program's strategy needs much work.

     /mnt/alan/:toys/teachgammon was removed to preserve space in
     /usr/public

COMMENTS
     The program is still under development, so a description  of
     any bugs found should be mailed to _a_l_a_n.

     Because of the dynamic  state  of  the  program  (constantly
     changing),   the   file   /_m_n_t/_a_l_a_n/:_t_o_y_s/_g_a_m_m_o_n._n_e_w_s  lists
     current modifications to the program.

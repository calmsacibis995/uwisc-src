# @(#)tan.s	1.1 (Berkeley) 8/21/85

#  This is the implementation of Peter Tang's double precision  
#  tangent for the VAX using Bob Corbett's argument reduction.
#  
#  Notes:
#       under 1,024,000 random arguments testing on [0,2*pi] 
#       tan() observed maximum error = 2.15 ulps
#
# double tan(arg)
# double arg;
# method: true range reduction to [-pi/4,pi/4], P. Tang  &  B. Corbett

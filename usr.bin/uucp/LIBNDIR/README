The purpose of this library is to simulate the new flexible length
directory names on top of the old directory structure. It allows
programs to be converted to the new directory access interface, so
that they need only be relinked when 4.2bsd becomes available.

CHANGE NOTICE:
The include file is now called <ndir.h> rather than <dir.h>
to avoid conflicting with the old style directory include file.
On a 4.2bsd system, <ndir.h> and <dir.h> should be identical.
Please notify me if there is a better solution.

In ndir.h, certain data types are #define-ed for the benefit of non-4.xbsd.
In telldir.c, lseek() is declared long for the benefit of non-32 bit systems

The call to telldir in seekdir has been removed,
because telldir had been thought to be wrong.
It is actually okay, but the call was not put back in.

Generalized article set manipulation
	Interface to subject listing.
	Recursive newsgroup visitation.
Virtual article abstract type to allow the following:
	Personalized header munging via % subs.
	Undigestification.
	Personal archive perusal.
	Mail handling.
	Remotely stored news.
Parent command (waiting for ARTFILE interface and recursive newsgroups).
Merge Pnews and postnews.
Vnews duplicate suppression algorithm for sites that can't do Xref patch.
Dynamic allocation of stuff currently restricted by MAXRCLINE.
	(And pull parallel arrays into array of structs).
Separation of .newsrc functions and newsgroup functions to separate processes
	communicating via pipes (to make fit on non-separate-I-and-D pdp11,
	or unreasonable facsimiles thereof).
Faster!!!
Smaller!!!
More general!!!
Perfect?

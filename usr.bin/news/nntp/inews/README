     This is a "pseudo" inews which allows remote posting using
the NNTP server.  Essentially it takes a bunch of arguments and ignores
ones starting with "-", expecting to find at least one which is
a file name.  If no files are specified, it uses standard input
as the input file.

     It then opens a connection to the NNTP server on the remote
machine and blasts the article across.  It then closes the connection.
If it doesn't find a From: or Path: line, it inserts them, in the
default format

	From: login@hostname.DOMAIN (Full_name)
	Path: hostname!login

where DOMAIN is a #define in ../common/conf.h, and should be changed
to reflect your system.  A good choice is .UUCP if you are not a
member of the Internet.  "Full_name" understands the & hack in
password files.

     "hostname" is figured out by what you've #defined in ../common/conf.h.
If you have defined GHNAME, it uses the gethostname() call.
If you've defined UUNAME, it figured it out from the file
/etc/uucpname.  Finally, if neither is defined it gets it from
/usr/include/whoami.h.  If you have GHNAME defined and your
gethostname() returns your fully-qualified Internet name,
undefine DOMAIN.

     The point here is that the thing looks like inews to any program
which would care to post something (e.g., Pnews, postnews, what have
you).  The difference is that the article will look like it was posted
on the remote end, not on the local end.

     Caveat: we determine the host to post to with the #define of
SERVER_HOST in ../common/conf.h.  This needs to change to reflect your
system.

     The "test*" files in this directory provide some good test
material for inews; you can just redirect inews to take input from
them or whatever.

     Thanks to Steven Grady <grady@ingres.BERKELEY.EDU> for
writing this, and for wasting a lot of his valuable time dealing
with the can-o'-worms that is the real inews.

# The following port is to a Develcon DataSwitch.
# The 'DIR' line is used to talk to other machines on the switch.
# See how it is used in L.sys.
# The 'ACU' line is used to talk to a call-out modem on the switch.
# In this case the modem is a hayes.  The 'chat' script
# makes the connection to the modem so the normal hayes modem code
# in condevs.c can be used.  Here the chat script
# 'expects nothing', 'sends a return', 'expects uest:'
# (the DataSwitch's prompt), 'sends outmodem',
# and expects control-g (the DataSwitch's connection prompt).
# Note, it is a current nit that the control-g has to be typed as is
# rather than as ^g or as \07.  Sorry.

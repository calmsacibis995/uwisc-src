.TH NEWSRC 5 "October 19, 1986"
.ds ]W  Version B 2.11
.SH NAME
newsrc \- information file for readnews(1) and checknews(1)
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I .newsrc
file contains the list of previously read articles and an optional
options line for
.IR readnews "(1) and " checknews (1).
Each newsgroup that articles
have been read from has a line of the form:
.LP
.IB newsgroup : " range"
.LP
The
.I range
is a list of the articles read.  It is basically a list of numbers
separated by commas with sequential numbers collapsed with hyphens.
For instance:
.LP
.B general: 1-78,80,85-90
.br
.B comp.laser-printers: 1-7
.br
.B news.misc: 1
.br
.B comp.ai! 1-5
.br
.LP
If the
.Ch :
is replaced with an
.Ch !
(as in
.B comp.ai
above) the newsgroup
is not subscribed to and will not be shown to the user.
.LP
An options line starts with the word
.B options
(left-justified).  Then there are the list of options just as they
would be on the 
.I readnews
command line.  For instance:
.LP
.B "options \-n all !net.sf-lovers !mod.human-nets \-r"
.br
.B "options \-c \-r"
.LP
A string of lines beginning with a space or tab after the initial options
line will be considered continuation lines.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Uuq
is used to examine (and possibly delete) entries in the uucp queue.
.PP
When listing jobs,
.I uuq
uses a format reminiscent of ls.
For the long format,
information for each job listed includes:
job number, number of files to transfer, user who
spooled the job, number of bytes to send, type of command requested
(S for sending files, R for receiving files, X for remote uucp),
and file or command desired.
.PP
Several options are available:
.TP 10
.B \-h
Print only the summary lines for each system.  Summary lines give system
name, number of jobs for the system, and total number of bytes to send.
.TP 10
.B \-l
Specifies a long format listing.  The default is to list only the
job numbers sorted across the page.
.TP10
.BI \-s system
Limit output to jobs for systems whose system names begin with \fIsystem\fP.
.TP 10
.BI \-u user
Limit output to jobs for users whose login names begin with \fIuser\fP.
.TP 10
.BI \-d jobno
Delete job number \fIjobno\fP (as obtained from a previous uuq command) from
the uucp queue.
.TP 10
.BI \-r sdir
Look for files in the spooling directory \fIsdir\fP instead of the default
directory.
.TP 10
.BI \-b baudrate
Use \fIbaudrate\fP to compute the transfer time instead of the default
800 baud.

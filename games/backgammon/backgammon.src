.sh NAME
backgammon - the game of backgammon
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd backgammon
[ - ] [ n r w b pr pw pb t\c
.it term
s\c
.it file
]
.sh DESCRIPTION
This program lets you play backgammon against the computer
or against a "friend".
All commands only are one letter,
so you don't need to type a carriage return,
except at the end of a move.
The program is mostly self documenting,
so that a question mark (?) will usually get some help.
If you answer `y' when the program asks if you want the rules,
you will get text explaining the rules of the game,
some hints on strategy,
instruction on how to use the program,
and a tutorial consisting of a practice game against the computer.
A description of how to use the program can be
obtained by answering `y' when it asks if you want instructions.
.s3
The possible arguments for backgammon
(most are unnecesary but some are very convenient)
consist of:
.ne 11
.s3
.na
.lp 16 8
.bn n
don't ask for rules or instructions
.lp 16 8
.bn r
player is red (implies n)
.lp 16 8
.bn w
player is white (implies n)
.lp 16 8
.bn b
two players, red and white (implies n)
.lp 16 8
.bn pr
print the board before red's turn
.lp 16 8
.bn pw
print the board before white's turn
.lp 16 8
.bn pb
print the board before both player's turn
.lp 16 8
.bn t\fiterm
terminal is type
.it term,
uses /etc/termcap
.lp 16 8
.bn s\fifile
recover previously saved game from
.it file.
(This can also be done by executing the saved file,
i.e., typing its name in as a command)
.s3
.ad
.i0
Arguments may be optionally preceded by a `-'.
Several arguments may be concatenated together,
but not after `s' or `t' arguments,
since they can be followed by an arbitrary string.
Any unrecognized arguments are ignored.
An argument of a lone `-' gets a description of possible arguments.
.s3
If
.it term
has capabilities for direct cursor movement (see ttycap(VII)),
.it backgammon
"fixes" the board after each move,
so the board does not need to be reprinted,
unless the screen suffers some horrendous malady.
Also, any `p' option will be ignored.
(The `t' option is not necessary unless the terminal type does not match
the entry in the /etc/htmp data base.)

.sh BUGS
The program's strategy needs much work.

/mnt/alan/:toys/teachgammon was removed to preserve space in /usr/public
.sh COMMENTS
The program is still under development,
so a description of any bugs found should be mailed to
.bd alan.
.s3
Because of the dynamic state of the program
(constantly changing),
the file
.it /mnt/alan/:toys/gammon.news
lists current modifications to the program.

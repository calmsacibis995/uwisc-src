---------------------
This directory contains all the info and sources that
exist for the Berkeley Internet Name Domain server.

doc	  - manual pages & documentation
bog	  - copy of Bind Operations Guide 
include	  - include files to go in /usr/include
named	  - name server sources
res	  - source to make /usr/lib/libresolv.a
master    - Sample data files
tools     - some test programs
sendmail  - modifications for 4.3BSD sendmail to support MX records

Here is how to install the name server:

1) cp include/arpa/* /usr/include/arpa  
2) cp include/* /usr/include 
3) cp doc/* /usr/man/manl
4) cd res ; make install (or cp res/*.c to /usr/src/lib/libc/net and
	rebuild /lib/libc.a. See res/README for details)
5) edit named/Makefile and change DEST to be the directory to contain
	the nameserver and related files (default is /etc/named).
6) cd named ; make install   <-- Make sure you build the resolver first
7) create the master file (samples in master/*)
8) edit /etc/rc.local to include:

if [ -f /etc/named ]; then
	/etc/named & echo -n ' named' >/dev/console
fi

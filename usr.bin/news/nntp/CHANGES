    This file describes the changes which have been made in NNTP
since the initial release.  Individuals who either reported or
inspired the bug/bug fix are in square brackets.

1.3	30 June 1986

	rrn is no longer included as complete source, but
	rather as a set of context diffs and a program to
	apply them to your rn source.  Many thanks go to
	Gene Spafford for an outstanding job doing this.
	[spaf@gatech.csnet]

	The dreaded kill/save bug is fixed; rn was passing
	/bin/sh too many open file descriptors.  Thanks and a tip of the
	proverbial hat to Chris Maio!  Change to rrn/util.c.
	[chris@columbia.edu]	

	Fixed a bug in rrn/artio.c which caused an assertion
	failure on line 114 of artio.c; artopen was returning
	Nullfp without closing the fp associated with the
	bogus article.  [genrad!ens@eddie.mit.edu, beorn@ic.berkeley.edu]

	Added #define PYRAMID in common/conf.h, added some
	#ifdef PYRAMID code in server/misc.c to deal with
	Pyramids not initializing static data to 0, as well
	as an fseek problem.  [spaf@gatech.CSNET]

	Another wait bug fixed in spawn() in server/misc.c.

	Added a required \r in post.c.

	Added signal(SIGCHLD, SIG_IGN) to server/serve.c,
	to fix exit status problem with ALONE defined.

	Statistics logging now returns sum of the nntpd and
	its children for process time.  server/main.c
	[fair@ucbarpa.berkeley.edu]

	Subnet support for access file finally added.
	server/subnet.c added, common/conf.h now has
	#defines for SUBNET, DAMAGED_NETMASK.

	inews/inews.c now generates a from line with the UUCP
	name instead of always using gethostname().  common/conf.h
	changed to add #defines for UUNAME, GHNAME.
	[jwang@atrp.mit.edu]

	Added LIBS to Makefile. [soma!sob@rice.edu]

1.2c	17 May 1986

	Support for Masscomp added (#define MASSCOMP in ../common/conf.h).
	[soma!sob@rice.edu]

	Syslog output now requires SYSLOG to be defined in ../common/conf.h.
	This is handy on systems which, for some reason or another,
	don't have syslog.  [soma!sob@rice.edu]

	server/post.c had arguments reversed in a printf.  [salex@rice.edu]

	rrn/common.h had PIPESAVER misdefined. [cspencer@bbncc5.arpa]

	server/group.c was missing a \r in a printf.  [lear@rutgers.edu]

	xmit/nntpxmit.c is a new version.  Highlights include
	improved error reactions and logging info.  [fair@ucbarpa.berkeley.edu]

	xmit/nntpsend is a shell script for sending news via nntp
	in a sane manner, with locking.  [pleasant@topaz.rutgers.edu,
	fair@ucbarpa.berkeley.edu]  The locking mechanism is provided
	courtesy of Mr. Fair's "shlock.c", in xmit/shlock.c.

	support/nntp_awk produces weekly reports from the nntp server
	logging output.  [fair@ucbarpa.berkeley.edu]

	Makefile (in this directory) would do a "make install" as
	the default action; it now prints a helpful message.
	[arnold@cgl.ucsf.edu]

	server/Makefile and support/Makefile had needless dependencies
	in them; if you didn't do a make depend, you'd have problems
	on a 4.2 system.  The server and support stuff now depend only
	on their own .h files.  [arnold@cgl.ucsf.edu]

1.2b	13 April 1986

	common/clientlib.c stupidly had some debugging printfs
	enabled.

	rrn/{artio.c,head.c} had sprintf("... %d", foo) where "foo"
	was a long.  %d -> %ld.  [cspencer@bbncc5.arpa]

	server/time.c had an order of evaluation problem in the
	macro "twodigtoi".  [fletcher@tzec.cs.utexas.edu, among others.]

	server/common.h included <dbm.h> if DBM was defined,
	caused multiply-defined NULL's.  [cda@opal.berkeley.edu,
	pleasant@topaz.rutgers.edu, among others.]

	server/active.c would lose because variable "i" would be
	at the end of the group array if it was called on a timer
	interrupt.  "i" now set to zero properly.  This only occurs
	if FASTFORK is defined.  [cda@opal.berkeley.edu]

1.2a	20 March 1986

	common/conf.h defined MAX_GROUPS as 300; this was too low on
	some machines.  Upped to 450.  [solex@rice.edu, beorn@ic.berkeley.edu]

	rrn/Makefile.sh had .c instead of .o for OBJS and SRCS
	respectively.  Also had cc -o ../common/clientlib.o (see below).

	inews/inews.c had (char *) 0 for gets(), which made SUN's upset.
	Changed to simply NULL. [brian@sdcsvax.ucsd.edu]

	inews/Makefile had cc -o ../common/clientlib.o which some
	machines don't do.  [brian@sdcsvax.ucsd.edu]

	common/clientlib.c has "untp" instead of "nntp".

	server/active.c made more robust about reading active file
	if active file is longer than MAX_GROUPS.

	server/common.h included common/conf.h after checking for
	DBM, which caused some problems.  [soma!sob@rice.edu]

1.2	15 March 1986

	Released.

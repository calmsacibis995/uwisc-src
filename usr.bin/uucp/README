INSTALLATION GUIDE
README	5.6	85/06/24

This version is based on the "rti uucp" that was on the 4.2BSD tape.
It contains many additional  features and fixes from Usenet,
Tom Truscott, Guy Harris, Lou Salkind, and many others.

A few new subdirectories have been added. Do a "make mkdirs" to make
sure that you have all of them.

I recommend that you change the uucp mail handler in your sendmail.cf
to something like:

	# Muucp, P=/usr/bin/uux, F=sDFMhuU, S=13, R=23, M=100000,
	# 	A=uux - -r $h!rmail ($u)
	Muucp, P=/usr/bin/uux, F=sDFMmhuU, S=13, R=23, M=100000,
		A=uux - -r -z -a$g -gC $h!rmail ($u)

The -a$g provides a return address in case mail fails (So It
won't go to yourmachine!uucp anymore.) The -gC specifies a grade
for mail. C is a good choice for mail. News should run at 'd'. This
way, mail gets sent before news. The 'm' flag specifies that this
mail can send to multiple addresses, which uux can.

The man pages now describe all the options for the various commands.
Make sure you read them. A list of the functional differences is in "Changes".

You should also look through the UUAIDS directory. There are some useful
programs and hints therein.

The maximum length of a site name has been changed from the old 7 to the
14. This is the be compatible with the HoneyDanBer uucp (aka BNU 1) which
is as close to a standard uucp as there is. Sites which have sitenames
longer than 7 characters that only send you the first 7 characters are
broken and should be fixed. However, there is a way of compensating for
this until they fix their problem. For each site you talk to that has a
name longer that 7 characters, put a line in /usr/lib/uucp/L.aliases of
the form:
	fullname name-truncated-to-7-characters.
E.g:
	tektronix tektron
	lbl-csam lbl-csa
	rochester rochest
	ut-sally ut-sall
(See UUAIDS/L.aliases for more details on aliasing uucp names.) If the site
name is <= 7 characters, you don't have to do anything.

This is a variant of the uucp used at decvax, ittvax, rti, mcnc, adiron,
duke and others.  There have been tons of bug fixes and enhancements
from people on the usenet (thank you).  Speed is substantially
improved.  This version fixes essentially all of the McGeady's bug list.

Enhancements:

Dialers			Lots of dialers included.

Subdirectories		/usr/spool/uucp is now split into 7 subdirectories.
			This is a huge help on busy systems.

/usr/lib/uucp/L.cmds	List of commands permitted for remote execution.
			A line of form 'PATH=...' sets the search path.

expect-send sequence	Escape characters now permitted: \r, \n.
			\r, not \n, is default char sent at end of string.
			\c	(put at end of string). Dont send ending \r.
			\d	pause 1 second (\d\d pauses 2 seconds)
			"" P_ZERO  `expect nothing, start sending zero parity.'
			P_EVEN (default), P_ODD, P_ONE other parity modes.
			\05	Send a control-E
			"" ""   `expect nothing, send a \r'.

uupoll [sysname]	Polls named system.
uusnap			Displays spooled files, and pending uuxqts.


This version runs on all VAXen and PDPs under UNIX-V7 and 4.1bsd, 4.2BSD.
It also runs on Gould/SEL Concept series machines (e.g. 32/8750), 
DUAL 68000 unisoft.
It also runns on BTL system III, IV, and V.

UUCP installers should read the two papers (by Dave Nowitz)
in Vol 2B of version 7 manuals and UUAIDS/setup.tblms.
Understand each step below before executing.
Some steps will vary slightly from system to system.

**** INSTALLATION *******

1. If you are currently running uucp, save the old programs!:
	su root
	cd /usr/bin
	for i in uucp uux uulog uuname	     (csh: foreach i (uucp ....) )
	do
		cp $i $i.old
	done					(csh: end )
	cd /usr/lib/uucp
	for i in uucico uuxqt uuclean
	do
		cp $i $i.old
	done

2. Editing Makefile and uucp.h
	4.2 sites using the supported dialers are all set with defaults.

	non-4.2
		a) sites need to install the Berkeley directory reading library.
			Try (cd libndir; make install).
			Edit Makefile to have LIBNDIR= -lndir
			define NDIR in uucp.h.
		b) Check LDFLAGS, OWNER, GROUP, and LIBUUCICO.
		c) pick a method to allow uucp to know its system:
			Check out GETHOSTNAME/UNAME/WHOAMI/CCWHOAMI in uucp.h
		d) define SYSIII if appropriate in uucp.h.
		e) Your "make" may fail because the Makefile is so large.
			If so, in /usr/src/cmds/make/defs, change
			'#define NFLEFTS 60' to 512, and re-make make.

3. Make the new commands.
	make

4. WAIT UNTIL THE UUCP SYSTEM IS IDLE!! Single-user is best.
	su root  (it is important that chmod, chown and chgrp work below)

5. Install the new commands:
	make install
	(If you are chicken, type 'make -n install' first).

6. Edit and install the control files:
	Look in UUAIDS.  Edit and install into /usr/lib/uucp if necessary
	USERFILE, L.cmds, L.sys, L-devices, L-dialcodes.
	THESE FILES MUST BE OWNED BY THE SAME OWNER AND GROUP AS
	THE UUCP COMMANDS AND UUCP SPOOL FILES!!! (probably uucp, daemon).
	The format for dialers is slightly different so that any dialer
	can be handled.

7. Make new subdirectories:
	For safety:  cd /usr/spool/uucp; tar c .   (save Qed files on tape)
	The following assumes your site name is produced by `uuname -l`.
	make mkdirs
		If your system is duke, then the subdirectories created are
		named C., D., D.duke, D.dukeX, TM., XTMP and X..
	rmdir /usr/lib/uucp/.XQTDIR
		which is obsolete (XTMP replaces it).

8. Move old Qed files:
	If you have spooled files, they must be moved into the subdirectories.
	Assuming all spool files are in /usr/spool/uucp
	(i.e. you did not have subdirs before)
	the following command will move the spool files
	to the right subdirectories:
    make mvspoolfiles; ??? does this work now??????????
	Files beginning C. are put in the C. subdirectory, and so on.
	Files begining D.dukeX are put in that directory, *not* D..
	(Note: if you already had a subdirectory version of uucp,
	you need only create the new subdirectories mentioned above
	and move the relevant files there.
    Delete other old directories if you had any (e.g. "LOG.")

9. Compact /usr/spool/uucp:
	cd /usr/spool
	mkdir nuucp
	chown uucp nuucp
	chgrp daemon nuucp
	for i in uucp/*    		(csh: foreach i (uucp/*) )
	do
		mv $i nuucp
	done				(csh: end )
	rmdir uucp
	mv nuucp uucp
		(Note: this does *not* work if a filesystem is mounted on
		/usr/spool/uucp!  If that is the case, you should 'tar'
		/usr/spool/uucp somewhere, unmount, re-mkfs, and re-mount
		the filesystem, and tar the uucp files back.)

10. Test the new system
	Test by mailing a letter somewhere and back.
	If it works, the new system is probably fine.
	Otherwise, figure out what is wrong.
	Start by examining LOGFILE.  Try /usr/lib/uucp/uucico -r1 -sname -x7
	If things are no-go, you can back out the changes by restoring the
	old uu programs and the spooled files.
	NOTE: The subdirectories foul up a non-subdir version,
	so be sure that subdirectories exist/do not exist as appropriate.


11. Install handy UUAIDS
	Look in uuaids for handy other stuff.  In particular, uu.* are
	shell scripts that can be run via cron hourly, daily, and weekly
	to keep uucp trim.  L-devices, L-dialcodes, L.cmds, L.sys, USERFILE
	are sample files.  THEY MOST LIKELY NEED TO BE MODIFIED TO USE
	THEM ON YOUR OWN SYSTEM!

	uu.hourly		Makes sure sites are polled.
	uu.daily		Runs uuclean to clean up /usr/spool/uucp.
				**IT HANDLES SUBDIRECTORIES!!
				Renames LOGFILE to LOGFILE.old.
	uu.weekly		Renames SYSLOG to SYSLOG.old.
	The above scripts should be run via cron.

	uucpsummary
		Summarizes LOGFILE and SYSLOG. It's very helpful in telling
		what is going on and who is calling who.
	uucp.daily
		Daily shell script run at ittvax.  Manages SYSLOG files in
		a convenient form for uuusage.  Not integrated in time
		for this distribution.

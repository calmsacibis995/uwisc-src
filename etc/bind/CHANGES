What's new.

	1) The "secondary" line in the boot file takes another parameter.
	   This is the name of the file to keep a backup copy of the
	   last successful zone transfer for that zone.
	   The line looks as follows now:

	secondary Berkeley.EDU        128.32.0.10 128.32.0.4 /etc/ucbhosts.bak

	This file is then read when the secondary server can't initialy
	do a zone transfer from the master server.

	2) Store cache data read from a file into another hashtable and then 
	   only use it to find the root name server. This is done by
	   building a query asking "who the root name servers are?"
	   This query is then sent to the servers listed in the named.ca file.
	   This leaves the authority for this data with the owner of the data
	   and the authority controls the TTL's and who the actual 
	   root servers are. 

	3) Fix some the data base load routines to be a little forgiving of 
	   errors when reading the files.

	4) Fix some memory leaks.

	5) remove support of defunct MD and MF records

	6) When dumping the data base quote HINFO since some 
	   people leave spaces.

	7) Only syslog " secondary can't find master" once per failure.

	8) Fix receiving an SOA for a sub domain when doing a zone transfer
	   for a zone which has a sub domain.

	9) Lay the ground work for sorting address in responces
	   for queries from the local machine.

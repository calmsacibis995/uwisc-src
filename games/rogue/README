Rogue has some user-tuneable options.  They are descriped in the
comments at the beginning of machdep.c.  Set the constants to be
what you want (either in the Makefile or in machdep.c) and compile.

Several of the options have to do with limiting use to reasonable time.
The comments should make clear how to do this for load average and
user count limiting.  If you want to do something else, you can just
change the function too_much() to check whatever you want.
